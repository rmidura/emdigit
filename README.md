# Early Modern Digital Itineraries

## Description

This project combines history of the book with digital approaches to explore how a database of sixteenth- through eighteenth-century itineraries may reshape our understanding of historical travel and communication. Digital spatial approaches often rely upon modern mapmaking and its built-in assumptions of up-to-date accuracy, decentered viewpoint, stable place identifiers, and direct distances. Instead, the temporal network visualizes a corpus of routes published across time, assigning "lifetimes" to cities (nodes) and routes (links) based upon their first and last date of publication. The following script is intended for use with data hand-entered from over 80 multilingual, international itineraries published from the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries. 

The data provided here represents the stage of work at the time of publication of Rachel Midura, Itinerating Europe: Early Modern Spatial Networks in Printed Itineraries, 1545–1700, Journal of Social History, Volume 54, Issue 4, Summer 2021, Pages 1023–1063, https://doi.org/10.1093/jsh/shab011. Drawing from the physical and digitized collections of European state libraries, the database includes more than three-quarters of identified itinerary authors (twenty-five of thirty-two) and nearly a third of identified surviving editions (84 of 299, see Appendix). The resulting database consists of 3,655 unique routes, connecting 1,587 cities, published and re-published over the course of two centuries. 

All titles featured in the appendix bibliography follow the format of a header (“Rome to Milan”) followed by a list of intermediary cities. Narrative guidebooks are only included if they feature such route tables as a significant component.

I distinguish between a “route,” meaning an abstracted connection between an origin, a destination, and possible intermediaries (“Rome to Paris via Milan,”) and an “edge,” meaning a one-to-one relationship between locations (”Rome to Paris,” “Rome to Milan,” and “Milan to Paris.”). Routes and edges both preserve the original directionality, distinguishing between “Rome to Paris,” and “Paris to Rome,” for example.

This dataset consists solely of the route headers found across the included itineraries and not the intermediary stops within at the present time. Further detail can be found in the included data schema.
